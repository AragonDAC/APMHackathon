# APM Hackathon

## What is APM?

**APM** stands for **Aragon Package Manager**. It is a decentralized package manager designed to handle the upgradeability of smart contracts as well as arbitrary data blobs. The best way to learn about APM is to read this [article](http://blog.aragon.one/using-apm-to-replace-npm-and-other-centralized-package-managers/) and read the [doc](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/apm.html).

## What is this hackathon about?

Most of us rely on NPM for everything we work on. NPM is far from being perfect, though: centralized infrastructure, security issues, lack of incentivization, etc.

The goal of this hackathon is to spawn a series of initiatives to enhance APM to the point where it become a serious - and backward compatible - alternative to NPM. As a first stop toward this goal this hackathon will focus on two topics.

### T0 - APM User Interface

All APM registries and repositories related data are stored either on-chain or over IPFS. That's great for decentralization but not so great for the end user experience.

The goal of this topic is to develop end-users interfaces allowing to search through APM registries and browse packages versions. Let's build the [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) of APM!

### T1 - NPM backend

For now, everyone uses NPM, right? So what if could we create an NPM backend serving APM-hosted packages?

The goal of this topic is to develop an enhanced version of [APM serve](https://github.com/aragon/apm-serve) complying to the [NPM Registry API](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md).


### Resources


## Process
This hackathon will start remotely on January, xxth 2019 and end up on site January, 30th 2019 - on the last day of [Aracon](https://aracon.one).


To meet potential team members and chat about projects head over to the [aragon chat](https://aragon.chat/).


## Submission Guidelines

Hereâ€™s how it works:


### 1. Come and chat

The best way to get started is to come and chat on the `#hackathon` channel of Aragon's chat. Ask any question you would have to the team, discuss about the ideas you would have with the community, coordinate to gather as a team, etc.

### 2. Create an issue
Once you know what you wanna work on - and with who you wanna work on - open a new issue in this repository. We have created a couple of issue templates so it should be pretty straightforward: just let us know the topic you relate to and draft a quick summary of the idea you wanna work on.

You can use this issue to coordinate with other participants or request for help / teammates in the Aragon Chat. Check out the other issues to see if there are participants who want to work on the same things.


### 3. Buidl!
That's when it comes to stop sleeping and start buidling. Use the issue you created in step 2 to let others know where your project lives.

Wherever you work, remember that your project should include an **Open Source License** of [some form](https://opensource.org/licenses), and should be accessible to everyone after the submission deadline.

### 4. Gather at Aracon

### 5. Fork and PR
Once you're ready, fork the repository, add a markdown file following [this template]() inside the `submissions` folder, and open a PR. These PRs must be pushed before **January 30, 00:00 CET** to let our jury enough time to review everyone's code.


*Opening a Pull Request establishes your project as an "official" submission*


We'd also recommend referencing the issue you created in step 1 [using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in your PR.


### 5. Enjoy the rest of Aracon
